# arduino-based-automated-fire-fighting-robot
This project builds a compact fire-fighting robot using Arduino Uno. Flame sensors detect fire, and the robot autonomously responds to suppress it. Challenges like sensor accuracy, motor stability, and suppression mechanisms were optimized for reliable performance.
